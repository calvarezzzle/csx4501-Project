# csx4501-Project Proposal

Introduction
- For this project I have decided to dive into the Canadian car sales market and develop an understanding. The dataset I found has the total monthly sales of SUVs from 2019 to 2021 in Canada. While it is easy to ask 'What are highest and lowest selling cars by size per year?' I want to dig deeper and actually breakdown the SUV market and be able to identify patterns based on sales per month in correlation to manufacturer. 

This data is important to me because it allows me to work on building a wholistic view of exploring data as opposed to trying to just solve one specific question. I find it more valuable in being to process all the data and give a detailed analysis of what happened than to say "this is what happened in this one scenario at this one point in time".

Overall, I expect to use visualizations as a way to guide the story of Canadian SUV sales from 2019 to 2022. A combination of manufacturer sales as well as total market sales I believe will help in understanding the SUV landscape in Canada. For right now, I am predicting that 2019 will have the most total sales but that 2021 will show big bounce from a dip in 2020 sales.
